# A study on the statistical measurement of China's modernization based on the electric vehicle industry chain development

## üåü Project introduction

Welcome to our project repository! This project is an entry in the **9th National College Student Statistical Modeling Competition** that we have participated in **May 2023**. Our research **won the third prize** and was successfully **submitted and recognized at the CONF-BPS conference The 3rd International Conference on Business and Policy Studies in August 2023** .

This study aims to explore the relationship between the development of the electric vehicle industry chain and green modernization with Chinese characteristics, and to quantify this relationship through statistical modeling methods.

## üìú Summary

Our research focuses on the basic characteristics of China's socialist modernization, with special attention to the role of the electric vehicle industry chain in realizing China's green modernization. The research is divided into three parts:

1. **Analysis of provincial modernization degree**: Use PCA principal component analysis and TOPSIS-entropy weight method to evaluate the degree of provincial modernization.
2. **International Comparative Research**: Analyze China's position in the global new energy vehicle market and compare it through indicators such as export volume and market share.
3. **"2030 Carbon Peak" Commitment Analysis**: Use the improved SIRD-NM dynamic model and deep neural network to predict the number of new energy vehicles and explore the possibility of realizing the carbon peak commitment.

In addition, we also studied the relationship between the penetration rate of new energy vehicles and national encouragement policies, and put forward reasonable policy suggestions.
